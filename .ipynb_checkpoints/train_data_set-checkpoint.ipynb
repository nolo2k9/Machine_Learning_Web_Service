    "**Neural Networks** are the base of Deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning. Algorithms for neural networks are inspired by the way the human brain functions. Neural networks take in datasets and then train themselves to recognise the patterns in the data using sophisticated libraries such as Keras. Then predict the outputs.\n",
    "Neural networks are made up of layers of neurons, similar to our own human neurons. These can be thought of as the processing unit for the network. These networks consist of 3 layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input layer - This layer takes in the dataset that is going to be trained\n",
    "- Hidden layers - These layers perform most of the computations required by the network.\n",
    "- Output layer - Predicts the final output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data is fed into the neurons of the input layer. The Neurons in the input layer are connected to the neurons of the next layer, these layers are connected through channels. Each channel is assigned a numerical value known as **weight**. Inputs are multiplied by the corresponding weights. The sum of these calculations is then sent to the hidden layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer is associated with a value called a **bias**. The bias is added to the input sum. The value is then passed through the **activation function**. The activation function determines whether or not a particular neuron gets activated. Activated neurons send data to the neurons in the next layer. This is called **forward propagation**. In the output layer, the neuron with the highest value determines the output. These values are in essence a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted output is compared against actual output to get the accuracy of a prediction. We can tell how wrong or right the network is by looking at the magnitude of the difference between the predicted and the actual results. **Back propagation** is then used to feed the data back in and re-train the model to come up with the most accurate prediction.[23] : [24]"
